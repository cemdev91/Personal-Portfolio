      <p>I currently specialise with the <span class="white-text">Drupal</span> framework but I'm looking to expand my knowledge  
        and work towards being a <span class="white-text">front-end developer</span> specialising with <span class="white-text">Javascript</span>. I've been 
        working on a lot of <span class="white-text">government projects</span> in Drupal and would like to commit more of my free 
        time working on this site and many other <span class="white-text">projects.</span>.

      <p>As well as developing, I'm an <span class="white-text">animal lover</span> (Especially Cats) who loves all things <span class="white-text">tech</span>.
        I've been a <span class="white-text">gamer</span> since I was a young lad and I truly believe <span class="white-text">video games</span> sparked my <span class="white-text">imagination</span>
        in <span class="white-text">art and technology</span>. I have a pet at called <span class="white-text">Jelly</span> who I can't say no to, and if I have any spare time you 
        will find me either playing on my <span class="white-text">PS4</span> or <span class="white-text">Nintendo Switch</span>.</p>

      <p>After completing a 2 weeks bootcamp course in Drupal I earned myself a position at a web agency called Waat LTD as an apprentice for 1 year. Having now
        completed my apprenticeship and successfuly completing my course, I have been offered a junior position. </br> I've worked on a handful of large government projects 
        and for other public sectors such as education and charity. Initially I started by learning to use Behat and test sites with behaviour driven development, writing 
        tests in gherkin. I've also been behind a site build and worked on digitalising grant forms. In my time so far whilst working for Waat I've 
        learnt to work independently and remotely on projects, as well as developing greater communication skills for understanding a clients needs. </br> From having just a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, to completing my two week bootcamp and getting a job in
        web development, I've struggled to work on projects in my free time, and this website is just the start of that! A large part of the struggle can be wanting to achieve too 
        much in a short space of time, so I need to reign that back in and focus on smaller projects and gradually grow.</p>

        <p>
          After getting some hands on experience with Drupal, I was tasked with creating a blog site which would document my progress through my apprenticeship and apprenticeship project. 
          The site was built using the Drupal framework in 2 days.

          Gamerverse was the project that I built for my apprenticeship. It's a site where gamers would be encouraged to engage with each other, creating new communities on and offline.
          A few ways this idea was tackled was by introducing a customisable profile which showed a users gaming preferences, engaging articles with commenting encourages, and a forum 
          which the users have a degree of control over the topics discussed.
