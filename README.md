# Personal-Portfolio
My new personal portfolio - A site I will use to showcase myself.

<h3>My name is Cem Salih and I'm a Junior web developer!</h3>
I currently specialise with the Drupal framework but I'm looking to expand my knowledge  
and work towards being a front-end developer specialising with Javascript. I've been 
working on a lot of government projects in Drupal and would like to commit more of my free 
time working on this site and many other.
